      <description>Traditional MySQL database backup methods suffer from serious data loss. When a production host fails, users can only restore to the most recent backup point, which may result in several hours or even days of data loss. In today&amp;rsquo;s data-driven era, data has become a critical element of production. Therefore, more advanced technology is needed to ensure data security.
To address the shortcomings of traditional backup methods, Aurreum has independently developed the Continuous Log Real-time Protection (CLRP) technology.</description>
