      <description>When it comes to data protection, what&amp;rsquo;s the worst nightmare for an enterprise?
Not &amp;ldquo;no backup&amp;rdquo;, but rather:
Thinking you have a backup only to find it can&amp;rsquo;t be restored. In recent years, many organizations have been drawn to a buzzword in the disaster recovery space:
CDP - Continuous Data Protection. Vendors often market CDP with slogans like:
 Microsecond-level protection! Rollback anytime! Instantly recover from accidental deletions! Restore to any point in time!</description>

      <description>As enterprises accelerate their digital transformation, data is growing at an exponential rate. Files, databases, VM snapshots, logs, user activity records-data accumulates by the minute. At the same time, the demand for robust data protection is rising:
&amp;ldquo;We need to back up everything, recover it fast, isolate it safely-and do it all with less cost.&amp;rdquo;
This is where data deduplication and intelligent compression come into play. These technologies allow organizations to store less while protecting more-efficiently and intelligently.</description>

      <description>As cloud computing, big data platforms, and SaaS services become mainstream, multi-tenant architecture has emerged as a cost-effective and scalable solution for serving multiple customers or internal business units. But with shared infrastructure comes a pressing question:
When data from different tenants resides on the same system, can you truly ensure that each tenant&amp;rsquo;s data remains separate, secure, and recoverable?
That’s where data isolation and recovery control in multi-tenant environments becomes critical—not just for compliance, but for trust.</description>

      <description>Background of backup and disaster recovery
In 1993, the World Trade Center in the United States experienced a terrorist bombing incident that shocked the world. At the time of the incident, approximately 350 companies operated within the World Trade Center. However, just one year later, that number had dwindled to 150. The remaining 200 companies faced bankruptcy because they could not recover their crucial data and information systems. This disaster vividly demonstrates the importance of data and IT systems to the survival of enterprises.</description>

      <description>With the increasingly improved management of information technology in industries such as healthcare, education, e-commerce, and finance, there are also more types of unstructured data, including records (schools, libraries), images (e-commerce), videos (hospitals), bills (finance), drawings (design companies), and more. The amount of data in enterprises has grown exponentially from gigabytes (GB) to terabytes (TB) and even petabytes (PB). Within this massive amount of data, there are often numerous small files, with individual file sizes below kilobytes (KB), but the number of files can reach millions, tens of millions, or even billions, resulting in a massive volume of small files.</description>
